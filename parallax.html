    {% pattern sections/basic heading="the lucky cat" subheading="parallax - 2019" text="The goal of this project was to use a camera and depth in After Effects to create a more immersive experience when scrolling through a website. The concept of my design was an ecommerce website that sells fortunes. When creating this design, I wanted to have floating pieces that would interact when the user is scrolling through the website. I did this by adding in gold coins that would spin as the user scrolls. It was an interesting project because I had to consider how I wanted all the pieces to fit together as they appeared on screen." image="parallax.png" %}
