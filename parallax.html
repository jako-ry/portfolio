    {% pattern sections/basic heading="the lucky cat" subheading="parallax - 2019" text="The goal of this project was to use a camera and depth in After Effects to create a more immersive experience when scrolling through a website. When creating this design, I wanted to have floating pieces that would interact when the user is scrolling through the website. I did this by adding in gold coins that would spin as the user scrolls. The colour palette is simple but vibrant and it uses traditional Chinese colours. It was an interesting project because I had to consider how I wanted all the pieces to fit together as they appeared on screen." image="parallax.jpg" %}
