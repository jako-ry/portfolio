I took a poster that I had designed for World Wildlife Day and I made it into a short video clip that would play as an advertisement. I decided to turn a poster into a video because people don't pay much attention to poster nowadays unless it's something very extreme. My original poster was simple and the graphics were fine, but it didn't stand out. The best way to reach a wide audience is to take it online and that also allows us to see the feedback: who interacted with the video, who liked it, and more. The video also contains a call-to-action at the end unlike my original poster" image="wwd/wwd.jpg" %}
