    {% pattern sections/basic heading="pac-man fever" subheading="isometric - 2019" text="The goal of this project was demonstrate the passage of time using an isometric illustration. As an avid gamer and a huge fan of retro games, I decided to illustrate Pac-Man and the process of collecting all the dots. The bottom left depicts the maze with all of the dots remaining while the top right shows an empty maze. I tried to keep my maze as similar as possible to the original maze, but made some minor tweaks in order to make it more complex and fit within the isometric measurements. There were some elements added to the exterior of the design to make the illustration feel as if it's a game." image="isometric/isometric.jpg" alt="finished isometric image" %}
