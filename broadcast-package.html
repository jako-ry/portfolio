The concept of my design was to create a playful channel about cats. Each animation piece needed to be bouncy and lively to capture the personality of the channel. The design used the same graphics throughout the individual animations to keep the package unified. The graphics were illustrated to be simple and recognizable within seconds since the time each graphic is on screen is short." image="maowtv.jpg" %}
