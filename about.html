{% pattern sections/about heading="about me" text="I've always been passionate about illustrating. It's always been satisfying to take what's in my mind and put it out in the world. I remember drawing with a pencil and paper for years and then I upgraded to a tablet and Photoshop. Now I'm happy to learn and use any tool to create an interesting graphic." text2="I am an illustrator at heart, but I love dipping my toes into every aspect of design. I've been interested in graphic design for years and seeing others' work always inspires me to learn and do more. I want to help people bring their ideas to life and to help them thrive." image="kaoru.gif" %}
